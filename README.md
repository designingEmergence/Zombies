Zombies - http://www.designingemergence.com/portfolio/zombies/

Zombies are the simplest way to create a system where two different types of objects interact with each other. Zombies chase People and People run away from Zombies. In addition, each creature contains a set of genes that contain traits defining their actions. Just like nature, the more succesful traits gets passed along and the humans and zombies evolve to get better at chasing/avoiding one another. 

Requirements:

  - Processing
  
Files: 

  - Zombies.pde: Main project file. Initializes and runs environment
  - Crowd.pde: Controls flocking behavior of creatures
  - Creature.pde: Class file for creature. Creature is both Zombie and human, just in different states

Method:

  - Load and run the sketch in processing
  - After a few minutes, you will see the characteristics of each type of creature change as they evolve
  - The counter on the top left shows the population of humans and zombies. Notice how the population ebs and flows between the two.
